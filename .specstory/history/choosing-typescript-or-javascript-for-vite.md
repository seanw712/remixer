_**Assistant**_

For a React/Vite project, I'd recommend using TypeScript over JavaScript. Here's why:

1. **Type safety** - TypeScript helps catch errors during development rather than at runtime
2. **Better IDE support** - You get improved autocomplete, refactoring tools, and documentation
3. **Improved maintainability** - Types serve as documentation and make code easier to understand
4. **Easier refactoring** - TypeScript makes it safer to change your code as the project grows
5. **Popular in modern React development** - Many React libraries provide TypeScript definitions

Setting up TypeScript with Vite is very simple. When creating a new Vite project, you can select the TypeScript template:

```bash
npm create vite@latest my-remix-app -- --template react-ts
```

Or if you've already started with JavaScript, you can add TypeScript to an existing Vite project without much trouble.

For your content remixing tool, TypeScript would be especially helpful for managing state, props, and API responses in a type-safe way.
